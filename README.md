# xlrd-parser

High performance Excel file parser based on the xlrd library from [www.python-excel.org](www.python-excel.org) for
reading Excel files in XLS or XLSX formats.

This module interfaces with a Python shell to stream JSON from stdout using a child process. It is not a port of xlrd
from Python to Javascript (which is surely possible).

IMPORTANT: this package is being moved over to the [pyspreadsheet](https://github.com/extrabacon/pyspreadsheet) project, which provides many new features such as writing files. It is based on the same Python/Node hybrid, but integrates with more libraries in order to deliver new features beyond xlrd. As a result, xlrd-parser is no longer under active development.

## Features

+ Much faster and more memory efficient than most alternatives
+ Uses child processes for isolation and parallelization (will not leak your Node process)
+ Can stream large files (tested with 250K+ rows)
+ Support for both XLS and XLSX formats
+ Can read multiple sheets
+ Can load data selectively
+ Accurate parsing of Javascript objects, including strings, numbers, dates, booleans and errors

## Limitations

+ Requires a Python shell (should not be a problem on Unix/Linux)
+ Does not parse formatting info

## Documentation

### Installation
```bash
npm install xlrd-parser
```

The xlrd dependency is installed automatically by downloading the latest version from
[github](http://github.com/python-excel/xlrd).

### Parsing a file

Parsing a file loads the entire file into an object structure composed of a workbook, sheets, rows and cells.

```javascript
var xlrd = require('xlrd-parser');

xlrd.parse('myfile.xlsx', function (err, workbook) {
	// Iterate on sheets
	workbook.sheets.forEach(function (sheet) {
		console.log('sheet: ' + sheet.name);
		// Iterate on rows
		sheet.rows.forEach(function (row) {
			// Iterate on cells
			row.forEach(function (cell) {
				console.log(cell.address + ': ' + cell.value);
			});
		});
	});
});
```

#### Returned object

The returned object is either a workbook object, or an array of workbook objects if multiple files were specified as the
source. The workbook object contains a structure of sheets, rows and cells to represent the data.

The Workbook object contains the following members:

* `file` - the file used to open the workbook
* `meta` - metadata for this workbook
  * `user` - the owner of the file
  * `sheets` - an array of strings containing the name of sheets (available without any iteration)
* `sheets` - the array of Sheet objects that were loaded

The Sheet object contains the following members:

* `index` - the ordinal position of the sheet within the workbook
* `name` - the name of the sheet
* `bounds` - an object specifying the data range for the sheet
  * `rows` - the total number of rows in the sheet
  * `columns` - the total number of columns in the sheet
* `visibility` - the sheet visibility - possible values are `visible`, `hidden` and `very hidden`
* `rows` - the array of rows that were loaded - rows are arrays of Cell objects

The Cell object contains the following members:

* `row` - the ordinal row number
* `column` - the ordinal column number
* `address` - the cell address ("A1", "B12", etc.)
* `value` - the cell value

Cell values can be of the following types:

* `Number` - for numeric values
* `Date` - for cells formatted as dates
* `Error` - for cells with errors, such as #NAME?
* `Boolean` - for cells formatted as booleans
* `String` - for anything else

For more details on the API, see the included unit tests.

### Streaming a large file

For large files, you may want to stream the data. The stream method returns a familiar EventEmitter instance.

```javascript
var xlrd = require('xlrd-parser');

xlrd.stream('myfile.xlsx').on('open', function (workbook) {
	console.log('successfully opened ' + workbook.file);
}).on('data', function (data) {

	var currentWorkbook = data.workbook,
		currentSheet = data.sheet,
		batchOfRows = data.rows;

	// TODO: handle streaming logic here

}).on('error', function (err) {
	// TODO: handle error here
}).on('close', function () {
	// TODO: finishing logic here
});
```

#### Events

The `stream` method returns a Node `EventEmitter` instance. Use `on` to listen to events and read the data continuously.

* `open` - fires when a workbook is opened (sheets are not available at this point)

  Arguments: the workbook object

* `data` - fires repeatedly as data is being read from the file

  Arguments: a data object containing the following:

  * `workbook`: the current workbook object
  * `sheet`: the current sheet object
  * `rows`: the current batch of rows

* `error` - fires every time an error is encountered while parsing the file, the process is stopped only if a fatal
error is encountered

  Arguments: the error object

* `close` - fires only once, after all files and data have been read

  Arguments: none

### Options

An object can be passed to the `parse` and `stream` methods to define additional options.

* `meta` - load only workbook metadata, without iterating on rows - `Boolean`
* `sheet` || `sheets` - load sheet(s) selectively, either by name or by index - `String`, `Number` or `Array`
* `maxRows` - the maximum number of rows to load per sheet - `Number`
* `debug` - log output from the xlrd-parser child process - `Boolean`

#### Examples:

Output sheet names without loading any data:

```javascript
xlrd.parse('myfile.xlsx', { meta: true }, function (err, workbook) {
  console.log(workbook.meta.sheets);
});
```

Load only the first 10 rows from the first sheet:

```javascript
xlrd.parse('myfile.xlsx', { sheet: 0, maxRows: 10 }, function (err, workbook) {
  // workbook will contain only the first sheet
});
```

Load only a sheet named "products":

```javascript
var stream = xlrd.stream('myfile.xlsx', { sheet: 'products' });
```

## Compatibility

+ Tested with Node 0.10.x
+ Tested on Mac OS X 10.8
+ Tested on Ubuntu Linux 12.04 (requires prior installation of curl: apt-get install curl)

## Dependencies

+ Python version 2.6+
+ xlrd version 0.7.4+
+ underscore
+ bash (installation script)
+ curl (installation script)

Windows platform is not yet supported, but it is only a matter of converting the installation script to PowerShell.
A Python shell also needs to be available from the command line, which could be installed via
[chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/packages/python).

## Changelog

### 0.1.2

+ maintenance release, deprecating in favor of [pyspreadsheet](https://github.com/extrabacon/pyspreadsheet)

### 0.1.0

+ can probe a workbook for metadata, without iterating on rows (`options.meta`)
+ can specify which sheet(s) to load, either by name or by index (`options.sheets`)
+ can specify a maximum number of rows to load (`options.maxRows`)
+ parsing of booleans and errors (such as #DIV/0!, #NAME? or #VALUE!)
+ new optimized Python script, emitted JSON is more compact which should further reduce memory footprint
+ sheets are always loaded on-demand (using on_demand=True)
+ better error handling
+ added JSDoc comments

### 0.0.1

+ initial release

## Thanks

Many thanks to the authors of the xlrd library ([here](http://github.com/python-excel/xlrd)). It is the best and most
efficient open-source library I could find.
