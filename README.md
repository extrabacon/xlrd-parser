# xlrd-parser

High performance Excel file parser based on the xlrd library from [www.python-excel.org](www.python-excel.org) for
reading Excel files in XLS or XLSX formats.

This module interfaces with a Python shell to stream JSON from stdout using a child process. It is not a port of xlrd
from Python to Javascript (which is surely possible).

## Features

+ Much faster and more memory efficient than most alternatives
+ Support for both XLS and XLSX formats
+ Can read multiple sheets
+ Can load data selectively
+ Can stream large files (tested with 250K+ rows)

## Documentation

### Installation
```bash
npm install xlrd-parser
```

### Parsing a file

Parsing a file loads the entire file into an object structure composed of a workbook, sheets, rows and cells.

```javascript
var xlrd = require('xlrd');

xlrd.parse('myfile.xlsx', function (err, workbook) {
	// Iterate on sheets
	workbook.sheets.forEach(function (sheet) {
		console.log('sheet: ' + sheet.name);
		// Iterate on rows
		sheet.rows.forEach(function (row) {
			// Iterate on cells
			row.forEach(function (cell) {
				console.log(cell.address + ': ' + cell.value);
			});
		});
	});
});
```

Cell values are parsed as strings, numbers and dates depending on the cell format.

For more details on the API, see the included unit tests.

### Streaming a large file

For large files, you may want to stream the data. The stream method returns a familiar EventEmitter instance.

```javascript
var xlrd = require('xlrd');

xlrd.stream('myfile.xlsx').on('open', function (workbook) {
	console.log('successfully opened ' + workbook.file);
}).on('data', function (data) {

	var currentWorkbook = data.workbook,
		currentSheet = data.sheet,
		batchOfRows = data.rows;

	// TODO: handle streaming logic here

}).on('error', function (err) {
	// TODO: handle error here
}).on('close', function () {
	// TODO: finishing logic here
});
```

### Options

An object can be passed to the `parse` and `stream` methods to define additional options.

* `meta` - loads only workbook metadata, without iterating on rows - `Boolean`
* `sheet` || `sheets` - loads sheets selectively, either by name or by index - `String`, `Number` or `Array`
* `maxRows` - the maximum number of rows to load per sheet - `Number`
* `debug` - outputs JSON from the xlrd-parser child process - `Boolean`

#### Examples:

Output sheet names without loading any data

```javascript
xlrd.parse('myfile.xlsx', { meta: true }, function (err, workbook) {
  console.log(workbook.meta.sheets);
});
```

Load only the first 10 rows from the first sheet

```javascript
xlrd.parse('myfile.xlsx', { sheets: 0, maxRows: 10 }, function (err, workbook) {
  // workbook will contain only the first sheet
});
```

Load only a sheet named 'products'

```javascript
var stream = xlrd.stream('myfile.xlsx', { sheets: 'products' });
```

## Compatibility

+ Tested with Node 0.10.x
+ Tested on Mac OS X 10.8
+ Tested on Ubuntu Linux 12.04 (requires prior installation of curl: apt-get install curl)

## Dependencies

+ Python version 2.6+
+ xlrd version 0.7.4+
+ underscore.js
+ bash (installation script)
+ curl (installation script)

Windows platform is not yet supported, but it is only a matter of converting the installation script to PowerShell.
A Python shell also needs to be available from the command line, which could be installed via
[chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/packages/python).

## Changelog

### 0.1.0

+ can probe a workbook for metadata, without iterating on rows (options.meta)
+ can specify which sheet to load, either by name or by index (options.sheets)
+ can specify maximum number of rows to load (options.maxRows)
+ parsing of errors, such as #DIV/0!, #NAME? or #VALUE!
+ added JSDoc comments
+ simplified and optimized Python script, emitted JSON is more compact which should further reduce memory footprint
+ sheets are now loaded on-demand
+ better error handling

### 0.0.1

+ initial release


## Limitations

+ Does not parse formatting info (performance impact)

## Thanks

Many thanks to the authors of the xlrd library ([here](http://github.com/python-excel/xlrd)). It is the best and most
efficient open-source library I could find.
