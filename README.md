# xlrd-parser

High performance XLS/XLSX parser based on the xlrd library from [www.python-excel.org](www.python-excel.org) for
efficiently reading Excel files from all versions and all sizes.

This module interfaces with a Python shell to stream JSON fragments from stdout. It is not a port of xlrd from Python to
Javascript (which is surely possible) and it does not use native bindings.

## Features

+ Much faster and more memory efficient than most alternatives
+ Support for both XLS and XLSX formats
+ Can read multiple sheets
+ Can efficiently stream large files (tested with 250K+ rows)

## Documentation

### Installation
```bash
npm install xlrd-parser
```

### Parsing a file

Parsing a file loads the entire file into an object structure composed of a workbook, sheets, rows and cells.

```javascript
var xlrd = require('xlrd');

xlrd.parse('myfile.xlsx', function (err, workbook) {
	// Iterate on sheets
	workbook.sheets.forEach(function (sheet) {
		console.log('sheet: ' + sheet.name);
		// Iterate on rows
		sheet.rows.forEach(function (row) {
			// Iterate on cells
			row.forEach(function (cell) {
				console.log(cell.address + ': ' + cell.value);
			});
		});
	});
});
```

Cell values are accurately parsed as native strings, numbers and dates.

For more details on the API, see the included unit tests.

### Streaming a large file

For large files, you may want to stream the data. The stream method returns a familiar EventEmitter instance.

```javascript
var xlrd = require('xlrd');

xlrd.stream('myfile.xlsx').on('open', function (workbook) {
	console.log('successfully opened ' + workbook.file);
}).on('data', function (data) {

	var currentWorkbook = data.workbook,
		currentSheet = data.sheet,
		rows = data.rows;

	// TODO: handle streaming logic here

}).on('error', function (err) {
	// TODO: handle error here
}).on('close', function () {
	// TODO: finishing logic here
});
```

## Compatibility

+ Tested with Node 0.8
+ Tested on Mac OS X 10.8
+ Tested on Ubuntu Linux 12.04 (requires prior installation of curl: apt-get install curl)

## Dependencies

+ Python version 2.6+
+ xlrd version 0.7.4+
+ underscore.js
+ bash (installation script)
+ curl (installation script)

Windows platform is not yet supported. I will accept contributions for an alternate install script that will also work
on Windows.

## Limitations

+ Cannot parse file selectively (will be addressed in a future release)
+ Does not parse formatting info (might be addressed in a future release)

## Thanks

Many thanks to the authors of the xlrd library ([here](http://github.com/python-excel/xlrd)). It is the best and most
efficient open-source library I could find.
